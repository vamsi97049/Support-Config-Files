Syntax to create sequence :
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
START WITH start_value
INCREMENT BY increment_value
[ MAXVALUE max_value | NOMAXVALUE ]
[ MINVALUE min_value | NOMINVALUE ]
[ CYCLE | NOCYCLE ]
[ CACHE cache_size | NOCACHE ]
[ ORDER | NOORDER ];

- sequence_name: The name of the sequence you are creating.
- START WITH start_value: The number at which the sequence starts
(default is 1).
- INCREMENT BY increment_value: The value by which the sequence is
incremented (default is 1).
- MAXVALUE max_value: The maximum value that the sequence can generate
(default is NO MAXVALUE, which means the sequence can generate values up
to the maximum value allowed by the datatype).
- MINVALUE min_value: The minimum value that the sequence can generate
(default is 1).
- CYCLE | NOCYCLE: Specifies whether the sequence should start from the
MINVALUE again once the MAXVALUE is reached. CYCLE allows it, while
NOCYCLE does not.
- CACHE cache_size: Specifies the number of sequence numbers to cache for
faster access. Default is 20. - ORDER | NOORDER: Determines whether the sequence will guarantee the
order of numbers or not (in a RAC environment).
